#Welcome to our prototypes storage
Choose whether you want to explore **CPS** or **CPS M**

To learn more about each of these drones, visit our [Facebook](facebook.com/cpsdrone) or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqbdxbvG6cqnh_S_RcGnWWg) accounts
Shortly, **CPS** is:
* the basing drone for underwater exploration using only your live camera. More compact, less effort, fun build.
* the modular drone for more complex underwater exploration. 4 slots for any desired modules [like water sampler, manipulator, pH meter]. Still compact form, more effort, super fun especially with modules.
