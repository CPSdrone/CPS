1st

pitch = arctan(Ax/sqrt(Ay^2+Az^2))
roll = arctan(Ay/sqrt(Ax^2+Az^2))
theta = arctan(sqrt(Ax^2+Az^2)/Az)

If Ax, Ay, and Az represents a point in respect to our original frame of reference, then the translated position due to a given set of pitch, roll, and yaw angles is given by the following formula:
Ax' = cos(yaw)*cos(pitch)*Ax + (sin(yaw)*cos(roll)+cos(yaw)*sin(pitch)*sin(roll))*ay +
       (sin(yaw)*sin(roll)-cos(yaw)*sin(pitch)*cos(roll))*az
Ay' = -sin(yaw)*cos(pitch)*Ax + (cos(yaw)*cos(roll)-
        sin(yaw)*sin(pitch))*Ay+(cos(yaw)*sin(roll)+sin(yaw)*sin(pitch)*cos(roll))*Az
Az' = sin(pitch)*Ax-cos(pitch)*sin(roll)*Ay+cos(pitch)*cos(roll)*Az
where roll, pitch, and yaw are all between 0 and PI

2nd

pitch = 180 * atan (accelerationX/sqrt(accelerationY*accelerationY + accelerationZ*accelerationZ))/M_PI;

roll = 180 * atan (accelerationY/sqrt(accelerationX*accelerationX + accelerationZ*accelerationZ))/M_PI;

yaw = 180 * atan (accelerationZ/sqrt(accelerationX*accelerationX + accelerationZ*accelerationZ))/M_PI;

3rd

yaw = atan2(sqrt(ax^2+ay^2),az)

4th

yaw = 180 * atan (accelerationZ/sqrt(accelerationX*accelerationX + accelerationZ*accelerationZ))/M_PI;

5th

magx = magnetometer[0]*cos(pitch)+magnetometer[1]*sin(roll)*sin(pitch) + magnetometer[2]*sin(pitch)*cos(roll);

magy = -magnetometer[1]*cos(roll) + magnetometer[2]*sin(roll);

yaw =  atan2(-magy,magx)*180/M_PI;

D = arctan(yGaussData/xGaussData)∗(180/π)
