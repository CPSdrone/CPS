PID test drone [deskodron PID]

This prototype was created to test our new PID system for steering, mainly self leveling. It is our first prototype in which we had 5 motors:
motor A, left front [up, down]
motor B, right front [up, down]
motor C, middle back [up, down]
motor L, left [forward, backward]
motor R, right [forward, backward]

With these motors it is possible to change yaw, pitch, roll as well as swim in x and z axis.

It consists mainly of 2 big 3D printed boxes and a wooden frame.



More about the prototype, assembly manual and other cool stuff will be added soon.
