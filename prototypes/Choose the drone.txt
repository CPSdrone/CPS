Shortly:
CPS is the basing drone for underwater exploration using only your live camera. More compact, less effort, fun build.
CPS M is the modular drone for more complex underwater exploration. 4 slots for any desired modules [like water sampler, monipulator, pH meter]. Still compact form, more effort, super fun espetially with modules.
