Welcome to our program storage.

At the moment all of our programs use Arduino IDE, so make sure you installed this program.
Second thing you need to do is to copy all of the libraries to the forder in the directory of your Arduino program, that is Arduino/libraries.

Generally, the latest programs are the best.
Right now, if you want to use basic CPS code, use version 5.1.
For CPS M, probably 5.0/first_OSD_and_cleanup is the best.

Don't look at the 1.0 - 2.0 so we won't feel ashamed.
