# Welcome to our program storage.

At the moment all of our programs use *Arduino IDE*, so 
1. make sure you installed this program
1. copy all of the libraries to the folder in the directory of your Arduino program, that is `Arduino/libraries`

Generally, the latest programs are the best.
Right now, if you want to use basic CPS code, use version 5.1.
For CPS M, probably 5.0/first_OSD_and_cleanup is the best.

> Note: **Don't** look at the 1.0 - 2.0 so we won't feel ashamed.
