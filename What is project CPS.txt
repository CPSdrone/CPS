CPS [Custom Printed Submarine] is an open-source project started by Filip Bu≈Çawa, Piotr Domanowski and Marcin Hnat. It is about creating a functional product of a innovative submarine, primarily with live streaming from camera in the drone. Project is based on 3D printing process, which allows developing various solutions for the form of a drone. 
Since the project is open-source, it will be easy for interested individuals to modify available models and programs and share with other people, who can eventually print it on their own 3D printers.
